<h2>Minecraft: A Creativity Goldmine</h2>
<br>In this site I will discuss the gameplay of Minecraft as well as the soundscape which the game occupies.</br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>Minecraft is an open sandbox game that allows each player to push the game past worldly limits.</br>
<br>Players explore a world similar to ours, but they aren't confined to our world's rules.</br> 
<br>Instead, they are offered a wide variety of materials and blocks to build with.</br> 
<br>The game also features different checkpoints such as defeating the wither or Enderdragon that help the game</br> 
<br>still have direction in completing it, even so, I believe the creative aspect of the game to be its main selling point.</br>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<br>To progress in Minecraft players must fight different mobs, build, and destroy in order to defeat the Enderdragon and beat the game.</br>
<br>While the game does have a direction, how the game is played is up to the players themselves.</br>
<br>Some players may find joy in the process, building whatever their heart desires, while others play the game for sport to see how</br>
<br>fast they can complete the game.</br>
<h3>Minecraft's Diversity
<br>1. Pleasure in the satisfaction of instinct.</br>
<br>2. Pleasure in vigorous activity</br>
<br>3. Joy in being a cause.</br>
<br>I think Minecraft exhibits all three of Lindley's reasons as to why we play.\<br>
